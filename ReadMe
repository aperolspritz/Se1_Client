Client-Server Architecture.

Client: 
- Represents an AI
- is in Interaction with the Server
- sends Data to the Server and processes its answers 

The concept of the game is a two-player contest played on a map that can be either 10x10 or 20x5. 
Each player controls a 10x5 half-map, which they must send to the server to create the full map.

Each half-map consists of nodes with x and y coordinates and a terrain (water, mountain, or grass)
and a fort (or "spawnpoint"). The players must abide by certain rules when creating their half-maps, 
such as avoiding islands and ensuring a minimum amount of each terrain type.

The goal of the game is for each player to find and retrieve a hidden treasure,
located somewhere on the full map created by the server.
The treasure and the enemy fort are not visible at the start of the game,
and can only be discovered by moving onto new fields. Players may not move onto water terrain. 
The winner is the player who successfully retrieves the treasure and brings it to the enemy fort.
